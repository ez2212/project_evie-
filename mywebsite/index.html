			<p> I am a current Senior at The Duck Institute for Duck Research on Ducks. My passion for ducks stems from one time when I was four and my mom took me to a duck pond. A duck looked me in the eye and told me "study me" and I have been devoted to this academic discipline ever since. Feel free to scroll through the site and see my projects and past research in duck studies. </p>
